hello, i am wondering if anyone can help me with building my first gaming PC \(i am new at this\), I want my pc to be able to run 2018 and 2017 games on high or ultra for example: Gta 5, Bo3, Fornite, Pubg, fry cry 5, God of war and maybe vr. Please tell me if its not possible :\) My limit is 1000 dollars to 1500. May have to work for a whileüòÇüòÇüòÇ. Ok so I am fairly new casual gamer, and mostly only like open world type games. I started out on PS4 with Skyrim, fo4, and the Witcher 3. Then my husband built me a pc, and we have been into PUBG. Then we found fry cry 5, it ended up being one of my favorite games ever. However it ended way too quickly. So I looked into other far cry games and ended up playing fc4. It was a good game but kinda sucked going backwards, it would have been better starting with 4 then going to 5. So don‚Äôt wanna. I am looking for a quasi gaming laptop, basically all I am wanting to play on it is the new batch of isometric rpgs that have come out over the last few years and maybe Civ 6 and Crusader Kings 2. No shooters or adventure games like Fry Cry‚Äôs or Tomb Raider. Trying to keep the price down so I am looking at laptops with integrated GPU and was wondering what chipset I should be aiming for? Thanks It's called fry cry undefeated. You play as an Australian fighter polite who's shout down by the Japanese. You are captured and sent to a prison camp. You escape into the jungle but get lost but luckily your fond by insurgents who are fighting the Japanese occupation and join them. In far cry 4 there was a side quest to track down a serial killer in this game it's a legendary Japanese sniper who killed hundreds of Chinese soldiers and was sent hear to break the insurgents moral his signature. I pre ordered far cry 5 gold edition on pc back in November and just recently found out about the fry cry 3 remastered which was one of my most played and favorite games ever besides bf3, when i looked it up i read article about how season pass holders get it 4 weeks prior to its release in summer 2018.And i also read its only for xbox one and ps4 but then others said pc, xbox and ps4 is it for all three or just consle? Cheers. You know this has to be the by god worst POST experience I have literally ever had with any sort of computer equipment. I bough the Samsung Evo 860 1 TB just a couple of weeks ago. literally a few hours after I bought it and the payment goes thru and my order is now finalized I get a email from newegg stating the hard drive is going on sale tomorrow. I hit up support and am like really, seriouslly? and they tell me that I need to cancel my order (which btw I couldn't cause my payment So I have various parts leftover from my old build and needed to build a PC for my sister when I go over to visit later in the year, decided to get some parts and put a PC together. The new Ryzen APUs are attractive budget choices but from the reviews I've read, the 2200g was the clear value winner and neither could really provide enough gaming performance for 1080p beyond simpler esports type games. I'll take the parts I need to make that later build (will buy a case when I get there). Given. Far Cry 5 since I got it has had the your driver is out of date warning for my graphics card. So I downloaded geforce expirence from nvidia's site and installed the GeForce Game Ready Driver version 391.35 (this is after already updating through device manager). It said the driver was optimized for fry cry 5, I don't know if that is because it saw I had it installed, it says that for everyone or what but the game had never crashed before this and now its happened twice in the last couple
