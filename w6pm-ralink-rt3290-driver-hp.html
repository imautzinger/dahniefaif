                            <p>help!!!! Здравствуйте, у меня стоит 8 винда. Не могу подключиться к сети,подключение ограничено. попробовала сделать все, что описано выше, результатов Hello techsupport, my family got a new modem 4 days ago. I was able to connect to the wifi all 4 days but I got dropped randomly and was able to reconnect (1st day: dropped for 15 mins my home network doesn't show up as an option to connect) I've restarted my modem & laptop countless times. Uninstall/reinstall my laptop wifi adapter. Also checked to see if it's up to date and to rollback. Good afternoon! Sorry i'm back again with another problem I was trying to fix yesterday but with no luck. We upgraded my partners laptop to windows 10 a few days ago its a. HP G350 G1 Intel i3-4005U 4GB RAM the wireless card this laptop has as listed in the device manager is. Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn Wi-Fi Adapter Now we can still search for networks, it shows up with about 6 but ours is not in the list. We have a Sky hub (doesnt have a model number on it.) the most recent. hi everyone, I tried to solve this problem on my own but couldn't hopefully you guys can help me for some reason and after working without a hitch for years my WiFi adapter ralink rt3290 a legacy product now started to misbehave at first the problem was with a windows process "system interrupts" having a high CPU usage and the WiFi adapter not working properly tried to update the drivers which worked for a while a week or so then the problems returned and now every time when I start I have the Acer Aspire V5-573G notebook. Lately I have been experiencing trouble with connecting to the internet, I can find and connect to Wi-Fi networks with ease but internet is either not working or very very slow. I think I don't have the right set of drivers. My Wi-Fi device seems to be Ralink RT3290, but Acer's official driver site only has them for mediatek and realtek. But not for ralink. I can only find fixes for HP devices but so far they have not helped me. Could someone assist. I have a HP 15 R043TU laptop with Windows 7 Professional running. Today I can't connect to my office WiFi. At home it connects just fine. The connection doesn't even show up to connect. But all of our other devices can connect with out a problem including my phone. At first I though I was not getting any signal and went closer but no dice. It connects to my home WiFi with out a problem. It's driving me nuts. I many did power cycles (both the laptop and the router) and DNS flush, changed After updating to windows 10 it doesn't seem to work anymore, even when I downgraded to 8.1. I have an HP laptop model: 15-r010si ,the wifi adapter model: Ralink RT3290. I had a dual boot: linux + windows, but I formatted the entire drive and reinstalled windows 10, but it still doesn't work. It didn't even work on linux when I had it. Certain drivers did work(can't remember which), but it worked only with very short distances(couple of metres). Status: NOT SOLVED. 
I'm sick and tired of the worthless RalinkRT3290 wireless card that came inside the HP ENVY 700-230qe Windows 10 64 bit desktop. I have tried everything including numerous driver upgrades/downgrades and power configurations to find the most stable platform. The maximum speed that I am getting is 0.4 MBPS while a laptop next to the desktop shows 12 MBPS. Can anyone suggested a network card to upgrade to? When buying the wireless card, is there a dependency on the motherboard Hi, A while ago I decided to make my old hp pavilion dm-4401eo useful, so I uninstalled Windows 8, tried installing Windows 7 (no-go, apparently.), so I went for Linux Mint. Anyhoo, I've had issues with the Wireless connection from the get-go. On some startups it won't even acknowledge the existence of wireless networks at all (when there is one, yes I've checked), sometimes it randomly disconnects, especially when using lots of bandwidth, so I started trying to fix the problem by going. Hi, thank you for reading this! My machine specs : - HP Envy 15'' Laptop - Windows 10 - 8GB Ram, Inte Core i7-4700MQ 2.40GHz, 64 bit system - WiFi adapter: Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn I could talk shit about this laptop for hours but for this specific issue: Issue My internet WiFi download and upload speeds drop to zero frequently(every 20-60 seconds) for about 2-4 seconds and then they go back up again. This is not a big issue when downloading stuff or watching series online.

Cause/Steps to recreate the issue =============. Hi guys! So I've been having this recurring problem with my laptop now with it's absurdly low internet speed when I'm using WiFi, even if I'm right next to the WAP. I've done everything from rolling back the driver to its original version, updating it back again, uninstalling and reinstalling it, all to no avail. I'm currently looking into the possibility of upgrading the specs (RAM, WLAN, possibly even my HDD to SSD) of my laptop. I've already looked into the manual and I was pretty bummed. I have a HP 15 R043TU laptop with Windows 7 Professional running. Since yesterday I can't connect to my office WiFi. At home it connects just fine. The connection doesn't even show up to connect. But all of our other devices can connect with out a problem. At first I though I was not getting any signal and went closer but no dice. It connects to my home WiFi with out a problem. It's driving me nuts. I many did power cycles and DNS flush, changed the DNS, uninstalling and reinstalling the drive. Hi, I'm connected to a router that services two apartments, depending on who's staying next door (where the router is) it gets pretty congested (sometimes 20 devices+) Some reason though, only my hp laptop seems to suffer, consistently losing connection or only getting 'limited', unable to load anything. I have set a fixed ip, and on the router's setting allocated more bandwidth to this ip, which seems to temporarily solve the problem. Does anyone have any other suggestions? Laptop How do I determine if I can upgrade to a dual band wireless AC card w/o having whitelist issues? I checked my manual page 45 ( and it lists my current 1x1 card: Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn. Can I install an Intel Wireless 7260 7260hmw 802.11 ac? I know the PCI-e half-mini is correct but don’t’ understand if the ‘chipset’ will work. Sellers on Amazon (https://www.amazon.com/Bplus-7260-HMWG-Wireless-AC-Bluetooth-HMCPartner/dp/B00HJCBV64) +Ubuntu 14.04 +HP-340-G1 +Ralink corp. RT3290 Wireless/Bluetooth 802.11n 1T/1R PCIe Im living a hell with the wifi drivers , i wasted like 20 hours of my life searching the correct driver , but still nothing , wifi is working with default drivers but very slow and disconnects all time  i can buy another wifi PCIe cards , but where im living , no one is sells it. My last option is buy a new laptop or use a usb wifi adapter in a laptop. lesson learned : nevermore buy a laptop with Ralink. 
I recently took my laptop with me on vacation but ever since I got back I’ve had limited wireless connectivity, whereas my other devices reconnected automatically. Now, the network troubleshooter says “’Wi-Fi’ doesn’t have a valid ip configuration.” I’ve read dozens of “solved” replies to this sort of problem, which often had simple fixes I already tried, and I’ve spent countless hours trying to figure it out. I’ve called my service provider and they ran me through some of these I recently installed the update to Windows 10 and was severely disappointed. For the past 2 days I have been configuring an installation of Debian on my laptop computer and have been unable to get the WiFi to function. After following various guides and researching the problem and the drivers for hours, it seems like there is no free, Linux-friendly driver for my HP Envy m6 Sleekbook's WiFi card. I followed all the commands in this guide Hi all - I've got an HP desktop running Windows 10. The computer is roughly 2.5 years old. Wifi device is a Ralink RT3290. Whenever I try to connect my home's network, it fails. Full "bars" for connection strength, put my password in (yes, it's correct), get the "checking network requirements" message, and. "can't connect to this network". I had no issues with the Wi-Fi up until a couple days ago. Nothing was changed and literally the only thing I can think of that was weird was my boyfrien. Got something really weird going on. Just switched ISPs. Everything works really great on my computer, all devices, etc. I'm having trouble with one specific computer. No matter what, its a limited connection, troubleshooter says its an "Invalid IP Config". OS: Windows 8.1 64bit Processor: AMD A6-4455M Brand: HP Model: Envy Sleekbook 6‑1111nr Network Card: Ralink RT3290 802.11bgn Here are the steps I've tried. 1. Reset Modem 2. Reset Computer 3. Uninstall network card, then reboot. Hello, just got a new laptop, HP Probook 4540s, 4GB RAM, 120GB SSD, AMD Radeon HD 7650M, Intel Pentium B980 2.4 GHz . It had installed OpenSuse and I didn't like it, so I put a Windows 7 on it, got some drivers, Wi-Fi driver worked, but I messed up with videodrivers and had to reinstall Windows 7. I didn't get any CD's with drivers when buying. Now I can't find a suitable Wi-Fi driver for Ralink RT3290(it's inside the laptop, not external), I think I installed laptop model: 15-r010si wifi adapter model: Ralink RT3290 Operating system: windows 7 Long story short I bought the laptop with windows 8.1. The wifi worked fine until I upgraded to windows 10. Then my wifi didn't work. As a programmer I also made a dual boot with Linux + windows. The wifi didn't even work on linux. So then I formatted the entire drive and installed only windows 7. Still having this issue. I can only connect when right next to my router, when I go to the next room nothing seems. 
I have a HP Notebook with Windows 10 and Ubuntu 14.04 dual-boot. My wifi and bluetooth drivers seem to be working fine in Windows 10, but not in Ubuntu. My wifi gets connected only when I use my laptop very close to the router and the connection is very erratic even then. In my bluetooth settings, it says that there is no bluetooth adapter on the machine. These are the results of the `rfkill ` rfkill list 0: phy0: Wireless LAN Soft blocked: no Hard blocked: (HP Envy 15 Notebook, Ralink RT3290 network adapter, windows 8.1) Hi. Living in a new apartment that shares a router across 2 buildings, sometimes 20+ devices connected to it (TP- Link TD-W8960N V5). Initially I could connect, but only a limited connection (not allowing me to load anything). This lasted for 1 week of troubleshooting everything under the sun. With the help of the router manufacturer, I established that the cause was the router being over loaded. When I reboot the router remotely.

I bought an HP laptop recently and it had windows 8 pre installed. So i installed windows 7 on it and for some reason, my pc cannot detect a wifi signal even though i have one throughout my house. So i decided to connect the Ethernet cable to this laptop. Nope not even that shit works. Ok so why not download the driver from another computer, put it on a usb and boot the software program on the laptop to get shit straightened out. Not even that shit works.
